3.In a managed system, our proposal intends to create a network that links an entire community to a hospital, immunization clinics, vaccine producers, and related institutions..

The system may keep track of information about the inhabitants of the city, the hospitals in the community with their staff and physicians, the vaccination centre, and the vaccination suppliers
